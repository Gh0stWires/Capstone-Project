# Pulp Design Doc

This document lays out the basic functionality for my comic book reader app. I created this to make sure I don't stray too far from the orignal idea and to keep me on track for what I need to work on. Not everything in this doc will be in the final implementation. But the core priciples layed out in it will make unforscene changes easy to implement.
